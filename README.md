Model/Monkey.cs:
We have added the c# code to get json data about monkeys.Additionally, because we will be using System.Text.Json to deserialize the data, we will want to add a MonkeyContext that will dynamically generate code for better performance.We are adding the monkey details in the collection view tag in the MainPage.Xaml.
